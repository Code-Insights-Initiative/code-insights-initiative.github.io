# Mission

Software development is a vast field requiring different skills and consists of various rituals. Coding is just a part of the puzzle.

Aspiring software developers start with learning to code with a focus on mastering a programming language. The programming landscape involves developing an understanding of fundamental building blocks offered by the language, toolset and idioms around the eco system.

Novice programmers would greately benefit by getting code reviewed by more experienced developers. Understanding the tradeoffs across different implementations from performance, extensibility and maintainability offers a more enriching experience in the path to learning software development.

As part of Code Insights Initiative, we offer a collaborative environment novice programmers to learn and master the craft of software development by engaging with professionals.

# Requirements

The initiative is open to programmers looking forward to enhance their skills and learn the real world requirement from a software developer.

This is not an initiative to teach the basics of programming language. This is more an opportunity to enhance and hone the skills from a software industry perspective.

## Getting started


### Java development environment

The immdeiate focus of the initiative is to offer a platform for AP Computer Science students. The course uses Java 11 for programming. Please ensure you have a local development environment setup.

### Using git

[`git`](https://git-scm.com) is a distributed version control system. It allows you to keep track of change history across software development. Some of the largest software source code is managed under `git`. The [Linux kernel](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/about/) and [Android source code](https://android.googlesource.com/?format=HTML) are some examples of `git` popularity.

[Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book is a great source to learn `git`. For those keen on learning `git` by watching videos, there are additional [git learning resources](https://git-scm.com/doc)

### GitHub account

Collaboration and code reviews are done on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/), an online `git` hosting service.

### Onboarding
