# The story

It all began with me forgetting to put my lunch box for wash till we realized the next day just before taking off to school. The confusion and chaos before I start my day at school had become the norm.

Like any other, I was deeply attached to my smartphone. My spartphone was something that followed me more than my own shadow! Ever since I got my first smaprtphone, my father and I have spent countless hours to automate the boring stuff. My journey into automation began with [Tasker for Android](https://tasker.joaoapps.com/), the one-stop shop for automation for Android.

We built a variety of automation, remind me with loud voice (text to speech) instruction to put my lunch box for wash with I reach home and connect to home WiFi. Reminding me to charge my phone when battery drops below a threshold and send my location as text message if I am not back home after a time. Overall, we had a perfect and dependable automation around most of the boring tasks.

Early exposure to automation and more demanding requirements convinced me that I have to learn programming and be able to do more than what an application can offer.

## Hurdles

Learning the basics of a programming language in a well structured approach is widely available. However, I struggled to tie my practical requirements and the programming exercises I was trying to solve. It soom became evident that I ned help from someone that could help me bridge the gap.

I was willing to invest time and effort but desperately needed guidance and direction.

Spending countless hours talking about various problems that can be solved by programming with my parent, I soon started getting more ideas and move fast.

# Fast forward

Once I decided to learn programming the **right way**, I decided on taking an introductory course and learn Java. The hurdles I experienced during automation revisited. The solution was to repeat the same as before and engage with someone having practical and real world software development and this helped.

Enrolled into AP Computer Science course, I began to experience the very same hurdles yet again.

It was then that started to wonder if these hurdles are specific to me or is it more common among other students. A quick poll on Instagram convinced me that we are all in the same boat and fighting to stay afloat.

Code Insights Initiative is a humble attempt to offer the same learning opportunities and methods that helped me to a wider audience. The sole purpose of this initiative is to encourage learning by involving professional software developers to bring in real world insights into programming.
